Judicious generates human judgments.

{% highlight python %}
import judicious as j

j = j.joke()
r = j.trolley_problem()
d = j.define("opsimath")
text = j.copyedit("The quack brown fox jump over the lazy dog..")
{% endhighlight %}

You can also represent individuals, creating multiparty interactions:

{% highlight python %}
import judicious as j

p1 = j.Person()
p2 = j.Person()

joke = p1.joke()
hilarity = p2.agree(prompt="The following is a funny joke: {}.".format(joke))
{% endhighlight %}
